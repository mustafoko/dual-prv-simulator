# Goal Sequences for Dual-Future PRV Simulation
# Both human and robot have the SAME goals (maximum conflict scenario)
# Each goal = place a box at that slot
# Slots: A, B, C, D

# Human goal sequence
human: A, B, D, C, B, A, C, D, A, B, C, D

# Robot goal sequence (SAME as human - creates contention)
robot: A, B, D, C, B, A, C, D, A, B, C, D
